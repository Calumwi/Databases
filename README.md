# Databases

In this module your objectives are:
  * **Design a database schema with at least two tables** from a specification, including a one-to-many relationship between two tables, and create the schema in a database using SQL.
  * **Use SQL to query a database** to read data from one table or resulting of a join, create new records, update and delete.
  * **Integrate a relational database to a program** by test-driving classes which implement CRUD methods to send SQL queries to a database.

You will achieve these by working through a sequence of exercises and challenges over one week.

## Sequence

Work through each of these exercises in sequence.

### Phase One: SQL Bites

Go through these exercises and learn how to setup PostgreSQL and use SQL to read and manipulate data stored in an existing database.

<!-- OMITTED -->

1. [Setting up PostgreSQL](./sql_bites/01_setting_up_database.ed.md).
2. [Using `psql` to load data.](./sql_bites/02_using_psql.ed.md)
3. [Querying data.](./sql_bites/03_querying_data.ed.md)
4. [Updating or deleting data.](./sql_bites/04_updating_and_deleting_date.ed.md)
5. [Creating new data.](./sql_bites/05_creating_new_data.ed.md)
6. [Using joins to query related data.](./sql_bites/06_using_joins.ed.md)
7. [Using TablePlus](./sql_bites/07_using_table_plus.ed.md)

### Phase Two

Go through these exercises and learn how to setup and gradually build a program which communicates to a database.

Some of these challenges include [Process Feedback Challenges](https://github.com/makersacademy/golden-square/blob/main/pills/process_feedback_challenges.md), in which you record yourself performing the task and share it with your coach for feedback. These are tagged with a 📡.

1. [Setting up a project](./challenges/01_setting_up_project.ed.md).
2. [Test-driving Model and Repository classes](./challenges/02_test_driving_model_repository_classes.ed.md).
3. [Designing a schema with one table](./challenges/03_designing_schema_one_table.ed.md).
4. [Test-driving a Repository class "find" method](./challenges/04_design_and_test_driving_repository_class.ed.md).
5. [Designing a schema with two related tables](./challenges/05_designing_schema_two_tables.ed.md). 📡.
6. [Test-driving  a Repository class "write" methods (create and delete)](./challenges/06_test_driving_write_operations.ed.md). 📡.
7. [Test-driving a Repository class with two related Models](./challenges/07_test_driving_repository_class_with_join.ed.md).

### Phase Three: Solo challenge

Do this project solo. It is designed to help you test all of your skills for this module.
