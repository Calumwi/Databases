Learn to write `SELECT` SQL queries with a `JOIN` to query data from two tables.

*Before moving ahead, make sure you're comfortable with [running `SELECT` queries from one table.](./03_querying_data.ed.md)*

## Introduction

So far you've been using `SELECT` to retrieve records from only one table. If we need to select both information about an album and about its artist, we need to do two queries ‚Äî a first one to retrieve an album, and a second one to retrieve information about the artist, using the foreign key.

```sql
-- First, retrieve the album
SELECT id, title, artist_id FROM albums WHERE title = 'Bossanova';

-- Then retrieve the artist using the foreign key value in artist_id queried above
SELECT id, name, genre FROM artists WHERE id = 1;
```

As our database grows and becomes more complex, this is not ideal. Every request sent to the database adds some extra time to the program execution. 

We can retrieve all this information using the same SQL query, using what is called a **join**.

Here is the general syntax:

```
SELECT [columns to select]
  FROM [table name]
  JOIN [other table name]
  ON [join condition]
```

Let's breakdown this example:

```sql
SELECT albums.id, albums.title, artists.id, artists.name
  FROM albums JOIN artists ON artists.id = albums.artist_id;
```

 * The first table we're querying on the left of the `JOIN` keyword is `albums`. We'll call this the "left" table.
 * The second table, on the right of the `JOIN` keyword, is `artists`. We'll call this one the "right" table.
 * We're specifying how the two tables are related, with `ON`. Since every value in the foreign key `albums.artist_id` references a primary key value of `artists.id`, we're using `artists.id = albums.artist_id`. The `JOIN` will match associated records by using this condition.
 * Note that we need to prefix column names (in the list of queried columns, and in the `ON` condition) with their table name, to remove ambiguity. If you forget to do this, you might end up running into this kind of error:
    ```
    ERROR:  column reference "id" is ambiguous
    ```

## The join result set

Let's run the following query:

```sql
SELECT albums.id, albums.title, artists.id, artists.name
  FROM albums JOIN artists ON artists.id = albums.artist_id;
```

```
 id |        title         | id |     name     
----+----------------------+----+--------------
  1 | Doolittle            |  1 | Pixies
  2 | Surfer Rosa          |  1 | Pixies
  3 | Waterloo             |  2 | ABBA
  4 | Super Trouper        |  2 | ABBA
  5 | Bossanova            |  1 | Pixies
  6 | Lover                |  3 | Taylor Swift
  7 | Folklore             |  3 | Taylor Swift
  8 | I Put a Spell on You |  4 | Nina Simone
  9 | Baltimore            |  4 | Nina Simone
```

Even though we prefixed the column names, we still end up with two columns `id` in the result set, although they reference different things. We can specify an **alias** in the list of columns to retrieve to avoid this:

```sql
-- We added an alias for artists.id using the "AS" keyword.
SELECT albums.id, albums.title, artists.id AS artist_id, artists.name
  FROM albums JOIN artists ON artists.id = albums.artist_id;
```

```
 id |        title         | artist_id |     name     
----+----------------------+-----------+--------------
  1 | Doolittle            |         1 | Pixies
  2 | Surfer Rosa          |         1 | Pixies
  3 | Waterloo             |         2 | ABBA
  4 | Super Trouper        |         2 | ABBA
  5 | Bossanova            |         1 | Pixies
  6 | Lover                |         3 | Taylor Swift
  7 | Folklore             |         3 | Taylor Swift
  8 | I Put a Spell on You |         4 | Nina Simone
  9 | Baltimore            |         4 | Nina Simone
```

You'll note that we have duplicate values for the artist name (the last column of the result set). **This is expected**, as we have more than one album record for each artist. 

## Other examples

```sql
-- Find the album ID, artist ID, album title and artist name
-- of all the albums.

SELECT albums.id AS album_id, artists.id AS artist_id, albums.title, artists.name
  FROM artists JOIN albums ON albums.artist_id = artists.id;
```

We can also filter the result set by using `WHERE` ‚Äî specifying the filter column.

```sql
-- Find the album ID, artist ID, album title and artist name
-- of all the albums
-- where the associated artist is ABBA.
--
-- (in other words, only albums by ABBA).
SELECT albums.id AS album_id, artists.id AS artist_id, albums.title, artists.name
  FROM artists JOIN albums ON albums.artist_id = artists.id
  WHERE artists.name = 'ABBA';
```

## Exercise One

Select the `id` and `title` of all the albums from Taylor Swift.

You should get the following result set:

```
 id |  title   
----+----------
  6 | Lover
  7 | Folklore
```

## Exercise Two

Find the `id` and `title` of the (only) album from Pixies released in 1988.

You should get the following result set:

```
 id |    title    
----+-------------
  2 | Surfer Rosa
```

## Challenge

Find the `id` and `title` of all albums from Nina Simone released after 1975.

You should get the following result set:

```
 album_id |       title        
----------+--------------------
        9 | Baltimore
       11 | Fodder on My Wings
```
